# Visualizing The Gender Gap in College Degrees

*Disclaimer: This project was inspired and partly instructed by the guided project of dataquest.io.*

The aim of this project is to visualize and analyze the gender gap in different college majors. The data in use comes from the Department of Education Statistics (USA) and contains the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012. Randal Olson, a datascientist at the UNiversity of Pennsylvania, posted a cleaned version of this data to download from his personal website.

## Skills Used
